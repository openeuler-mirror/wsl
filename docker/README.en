# OpenEuler WSL Common Problems

## Automatically exits TMOUT

For security reasons, openEuler defines TMOUT=300 in the /etc/bashrc file to disable logout on timeout if no operation is performed on the console for 300 seconds. I have deleted the "export TMOUT=300" line so that it does not automatically exit, and can be added back if necessary

## Network connection problem
Because Microsoft has modified the network configuration, if you use VPN or other software, please shut down VPN, restart the computer to try to fix the problem. If you're not using a VPN, a reboot can usually fix the problem too.
